# Portfolio Website

A basic web application used to show the different topics and exercises done in our Online Media Course. In addition: serves as a website to display personal art portfolio and small CV.

## Project structure

1. Portfolio

A general overview of my art projects and illustration: usually the first website people will want to look at: aimed to give a good impression upon first glance.

2. About

A small introduction about myself, together with a summary of my life acitivities, such as my previous studies. As well as a digital self-portrait of myself done a while back to show people a face to the artworks.

3. Contact

If people want to get in contact with me, they are open to do so by three different ways! 

4. Class Projects

A drop down menu will lead to the five different topics covered in class. Each section will cover theoretical aspects as well as showcase the exercices done. 

Because that would be a little exhausting to read through, my little, self-made mascot "Phrog" will keep you company while you work through the topics.
