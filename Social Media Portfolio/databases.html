                <h1>Data Storage and Databases</h1>
                <strong>What are we talking about here? </strong>
                <p>Data storage refers to the organization and retention of information in a structure manner, so that it can later be retrieved and manipulated easily. In the context of web development, they play a central role. It is essential for  handling large  amounts of information and also support functionalities like user authentication and content management. </p>

                <strong>Relational Database</strong>
                <p>In an exercise of bringing more complicated terms closer to us, we were each given a keyword that we received a certain amount of time to research for.  Our keyword was ‘’Relational Database” and after thorough research, I concluded the term the following:</p>
            <p>- short RDB, a way of structuring information in tables rows and columns.</p>
            <p>- developed or at least based on an idea by Edgar F. Codd in the 1970s</p>
            <p>- introduced the term in his research paper and defined what he meant by relational</p>
            <p>- method is to present data to users as relations, so that means that the term relational referes to the concept of relationships between tables for example</p>
            <p>- these relationships are established through keys</p>
            <p>- each table has for example keys that uniquely identify each one</p>
            <p><strong>Different Keys:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Primary:</strong>it ensures that each row in the tables can be uniquely identified and it can not contain any NULL values (a placeholder for a missing value or an absence of data in a specific place)</p>
            <p><strong>Foreign:</strong>a field or a set of fields in one table that refers to the primary key in another table, so it essentially creates a link between them (relationship)</p>
            <p><strong>Unique:</strong></p>unique key: similar to primary key, it also ensures that a column has unique values but it can allow NULL values unlike the primary key 
            <p><strong>Composite:</strong></p>consists of multiple columns that when combined can uniquely identify a record (single row in a table that contains a complete set of information) within a table (library example)
            <p><strong>Types of Relationships:</strong> one - to - one, so record of table a corresponds to record in table B, one to many: one record in table a links to multiple in table b, many - to many- multiple records from a to multiple to b </p>
            <p>relationships enabe efficient data retrieval and management, so everything works accordingly across tables</p>
            <p>In conclusion, this part of the course focused on helping us understand how databases are essential for a structured collection of data and is designed to effectively manage, story and retrieve information.</p>
